Use envoic when the user asks to audit or clean development environments, stale dependencies, disk-heavy caches, or broken local setups.

Workflow:
1. Discover first with `scan`.
2. Quantify with `--deep` if cleanup prioritization is needed.
3. Use dry-run before deletion.
4. Keep safety constraints from `skills/envoic/references/safety.md`.
