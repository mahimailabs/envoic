When a user asks about disk cleanup, stale environments, `node_modules` bloat, ENOSPC, or broken Python/JS environments, use envoic workflows.

Preferred flow:
1. Run scan first (`uvx envoic scan <path>` or `npx envoic scan <path>`).
2. Use `--deep` when size ranking is needed.
3. Use `manage --dry-run` before any deletion.
4. Warn for CAREFUL artifacts (`.tox/`, `.nox/`, `*.egg-info`).
5. Never remove lock files or project manifests.
